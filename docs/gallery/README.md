# Gallery

Here is the collection of community-submitted examples of prompt's theme by using Starship.

## How to Walk Through the Gallery

In this section, you can:

- see many themes
- download the configuration file of Starship called `starship.toml` of each theme
- see `starship.toml` of each theme on GitHub

When you mouse over the image of each theme, two buttons appear: "Download the starship.toml" and "View the starship.toml on GitHub".

If you are a newcomer to Starship and wanna use themes in the Gallery, please see the [Guide - Installation](http://localhost:8080/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation) and [Configuration](/config/) at first.

## Contribution to the Gallery

If you wanna add your theme to the Gallery, you can do this by creating a pull request to [the repository of Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) on GitHub.
